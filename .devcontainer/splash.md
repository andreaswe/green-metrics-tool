## Green Metrics Tool Codespaces Quickstart

Thank you for trying out the Green Metrics Tool :-)

Please run `source .devcontainer/workshop/codespace-setup.sh` to set up everything! ðŸš€

It will take about 60 seconds.

Do your first run like this: `python3 runner.py --name test --uri /workspaces/green-metrics-tool/example-applications/stress/`

To see the Metrics front end, go to your ports tab and follow the forwarding address for port 9143
